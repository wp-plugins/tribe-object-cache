= Important Notes =

This DOES NOT work on a MU Network admin. If you want to install on MU, then install it on only one of the blogs and it will work for the whole network.

It is possible that wp-content is not itself writable by the server. If that is the case, then this plugin will not be able to copy the object-cache.php file into the wp-content folder. In that case all you need to do is copy wp-content/plugins/tribe-object-cache/lib/object-cache.php to wp-content/object-cache.php.

Do not change the plugin folder name. This plugin has to be in plugins/tribe-object-cache for it to work!
